user_description: I have 6 years of experience in web development. I have been a front-end developer who converts design submitted by the client into a responsive web page using the most appropriate technology for the design, and a back-end developer who converts business requirements into working system functions or features using the most efficient and effective tools to meet the established requirements. I am an achiever and goal-oriented person who is keen to details and would like to keep everything in a systematic manner.
